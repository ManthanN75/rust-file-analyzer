# The Authority of God: Questions of Faith in an Unequal World
We grow up with beliefs about God being handed to us like family heirlooms. "God is good," our parents say. "God is on our side. God is always there." Some refer to this force as the Universe or Nature, but I'll call it God in this case.
We're told things such as "Good things happen to good people" ("ACHE KE SAATH ACHA HI HOTA HAI"). But as I've grown older, I've found myself struggling with contradictions that challenge these simplistic childhood teachings.
Believe in the Divine Justice
If God is so good, why do some starve for a meal and others casually waste food? If there is divine justice, why do some influential people apparently get away scot-free while others suffer continuously? Where are the fulfilled prayers we are assured of in temples, mosques, and gurudwaras?
> ***"God enjoys watching. He's a prankster. I swear, for His own entertainment, His own personal cosmic gag reel, He makes the rules in contradiction. And while you're hopping from foot to foot, what's He doing? He's laughing His sick, fucking ass off!"*** - Al Pacino as John Milton in "The Devil's Advocate"
This thought-provoking view may sound radical; but is it not sometimes true? I ask myself: if there is a good god, why do corporate moguls who pursue shady dealings prosper and their unemployed workers or employees who were sacked often end up in misery or worse? Where is the law of karma here? The working and under classes are conditioned to tremble at the thought of divine retribution, but does God unintentionally practice prejudice according to economic class?
And what of religious ceremonies that seem incompatible with compassion? How does a compassionate God demand sacrifice—animal or, in the past, even human—to placate God's anger?
## Divine Justice Across Traditions
Various religious traditions give varying responses to these questions:
1. Hindu philosophy teaches that divine beings like Yama and Vishnu uphold justice through the law of karma, where deeds determine fates in a cycle of reincarnation. The Manusmriti states: "Justice, being preserved, preserves; violated, it destroys."
2. Buddhism holds that justice operates through karma without a personal god—good deeds bring happiness; bad ones suffering. The Dhammapada teaches: "Cease from evil, do good, purify the mind."
3. Judaism depicts God as merciful but just, rewarding righteousness and punishing evil, such as in narratives such as Sodom and Gomorrah.
4. Islam places God's justice at its center—God commands justice and forbids evil, with ultimate accountability on Judgment Day.
5. Christianity emphasizes a God of justice and mercy, with final judgment based on what we've done and where our hearts have been.
## Astronomical Perspective
I often take a step back and think about the grandness of life. With eight billion individuals on this planet, would God care about my individual prayers? Does God even hear when an individual prays for the next meal, a sports car, exam grades, love, or for the health of a parent?
Maybe God is only what we wish to believe. Maybe the divine is something more than the simplistic answers we are told.
## Sacred Spaces and Violence
One such question that has been troubling me of late is: Why do people invoke God to justify violence or war over sacred places like Jerusalem or Ram Mandir, when all religions preach justice, peace, and compassion? Is divine justice really in favor of such acts, or do these constitute only human misinterpretations of holy commands? This discrepancy between religious commands and human actions is a huge tension.
## The Divine Paradoxes
These introduce more profound philosophical puzzles:
- **Justice and Mercy**: God is usually portrayed as being infinitely merciful but perfectly just in most traditions. How do they exist together? When does mercy supersede justice, or vice versa?
- **Transcendence and Immanence**: Is God far and above human affairs, or close to the life of every individual? Can the divine accomplish both?
- **Divine Will and Human Freedom**: How do various religions balance God's sovereignty with free will in humanity? If God has a plan, do our choices actually make a difference?
## The Atheist Angle
What if there is no master plan? No judgment day, no karma? What if pain is just physics, biology, and human greed—not tests from God? Einstein once stated, "The universe is not benevolent or malevolent. It just doesn't care."
## What Comes Next
Is God a celestial accountant tallying up karma, a subtle force of nature, or a human invention to cope with randomness? In Part 2, we disassemble the Problem of Evil: Why bad things happen if God's good. Spoiler: Science, saints, and skeptics have fought over this for millennia. Who's ahead? You decide.
## Join the Conversation
These are questions that have plagued humanity for thousands of years, and I am not claiming to have all the answers. In subsequent chapters of this series,we shall examine possible answers to these theological puzzles, balancing views from theologians, philosophers, scientists, and regular practitioners of faith.I welcome all views in the comments—whether you're religiously devout, atheistically staunch, or somewhere in between. Blunt views, hard questions, and even gracious disagreement are all worth bringing to the table. Isn't questioning after all what spiritual evolution is all about, though? Read on to Part 2, where we discuss further potential solutions to these fundamental questions of God's nature and divine justice in our complex world.
